This repository contains two algorithmic trading strategies implemented using Python:

1. **Mean Reversion Strategy**
- A mean reversion trading strategy assumes that asset prices will revert to their historical average over time, and traders buy when prices are below the mean and sell when they are above, expecting a return to the mean.
2. **Moving Averages Strategy**
- A three moving average trading strategy involves using short, medium, and long-term moving averages, where buy signals occur when the shorter moving averages cross above the longer ones, and sell signals happen when they cross below, identifying trends and their strength.

Both strategies leverage historical market data collected via the Polygon API, followed by data processing, strategy building, backtesting, and performance analysis.
