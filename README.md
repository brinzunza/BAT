## Strategies

### Mean Reversion Strategy
This strategy is based on the assumption that asset prices tend to revert to their historical average over time. 
The algorithm:
- Buys when prices fall below the historical mean*
- Sells when prices rise above the historical mean*

### Moving Averages Strategy
This strategy uses three moving averages (short, medium, and long-term) to identify trends and generate trading signals:
- Buy signals occur when shorter moving averages cross above longer ones*
- Sell signals occur when shorter moving averages cross below longer ones*

## Future Improvements
- Implement additional strategies (e.g., momentum, sentiment analysis)
- Optimize parameters using machine learning techniques
- Integrate real-time data feeds for live trading
